# Hi, and welcome to my readme for my Programming Language Guessing Game!

My main goal for this project was to create a word guessing game using nothing but vanilla javascript and Bootstrap for styling.

I had a list of how I wanted my game to play out and achieving this was a long but educational experience.

### How I Wanted The Game To Play Out
1. Choose a random word from a array of choices.
2. Setup a function to split the chosen word into a new array made up of each letter.
3. create an array of blank spaces equal to the length of the chosen word.
4. If a player guesses wrong, subtract from guesses and add their guess to a list of guesses.
5. When the player guesses a correct letter, reveal the hidden letters and get rid of the space for it.
6. If they run out of guesses, they lose.
7. If they guess all the letters, they win.
